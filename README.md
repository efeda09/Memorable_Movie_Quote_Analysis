Prior research on memorable movie quotes have centered around the “what” – lexical and linguistic analysis the quotes [1]. We sought to understand the “who” – how the identity of the speaker correlates with a memorable quote’s semantic connotation. Specifically, we studied quotes from the Cornell Movie-Quotes Corpus, which contained a collection of 6282 of one-line movie quotes labeled to be “memorable” by human annotators from 1068 movies. We were interested in understanding: 
1) What is the gender and age distribution of actors who deliver memorable quotes? 
2) How does the sentiment of memorable quotes evolve over time when conditioned on the actor’s age and gender?
3) Are there particular topical themes among the memorable quotes?

We found that: 
1) Memorable quotes are predominantly delivered by male and middle-aged actors.
2) Sentiment analysis shows a slight decline in sentiment positivity when conditioned on gender and age.
3) Female actors consistently deliver more positive quotes than male actors, and actors under 18 exhibit the greatest fluctuation in sentiment over time.
4) While word frequency analysis highlights thematic differences between male and female actor’s quotes, our clustering suggests that there are no universally dominant themes that define memorability. Quotes seem to stand out due to their inherent ability to resonate rather than the result of some formulaic construction, an insight informative to the filmmaker and comforting viewers like us.
